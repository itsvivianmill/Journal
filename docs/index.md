# Journal
Hi! This is my personal journal relating to technology. I am using Obsidian to create and journal using the [[GitHub-Quartz-Obsidian]] to publish my journal. The template I used at the start is derived from the [Growlf](https://growlf.github.io/journal/) Github.
## Who am I?
My name is Vivian Miller and I am a student at BTC. I love technology, sewing, going hiking, playing card games and love supporting different communities such as LinuxFest Northwest, GenCyber, and many more!
