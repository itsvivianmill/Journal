Today, I learned about how Prometheus and [[Grafana]] work in tandem. 

Prometheus is an application which we are using as a database (although can be used as standalone and has its own monitoring) that will collect any information from all systems on the server, while Grafana is a monitoring service that uses Prometheus to display the information. 

Our team is doing a test set-up using a [Proxmox Grafana community script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=grafana) (slowly build it for production). On one of our server's nodes, we applied the script and set-up with advanced settings (main purpose is to up the cores to 4 because multiple people will be accessing the UI at peak hours).

Accessing the Grafana dashboard was successful, so we started to install Prometheus using the [community script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=prometheus). 

On the other nodes, we install the Prometheus Exporter using a script Garth created and edit the /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml to add the docker nodes to be monitored.

###### Quick:
- sudo tee -a /path/to/file >> /path/to/file << 'EOF'
	command
	command
	command
	EOF

- systemctl daemon-reload is important for the .yml in /etc/ to run
- systemctl restart prometheus.service
