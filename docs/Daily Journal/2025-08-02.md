Today, our team kick-started our SOC2 Intent for the Bellingham Makerspace! We started out by planning the issues that already exist and created tickets in our Leantime server.

I pivoted and started to create the logical network diagram using draw.io and I later plan to create the physical diagram using Cisco Packet Tracer. 

We accessed the Ansible [[Semaphore]] LXC on the Proxmox server by finding the login in the virtual machine and we discussed the usage of the application to automate specific tasks. 

A new VM called turnkey-gitlab was created to connect to the Semaphore LXC because it needs to have a GitHub repository (decided on a local one).
