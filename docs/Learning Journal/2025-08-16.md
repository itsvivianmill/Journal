Today, I learned that [[Docker]] overlay networks can be visualized as VLANs. In this context, DNS entries can be routed to different overlay networks to interact with the Portainer service. 

On one of our overlay networks, a service called Nginx Proxy Manager is running to proxy HTTP services and slaps on an SSL certificate so it can become an HTTP/S service; when a web service is requested, the service hits the [[Technitium]] DNS server first. On some of the DNS records, the web services will recorded as a CNAME instead of an A record because of that ability to have an SSL certificate. 

Our team pivoted to working on shrinking our Cephs and LVM volumes in Proxmox to create a ZFS raid storage system. The reason is because LVM storage remains on a singular node and cannot be used across other nodes (if the original node goes down, so does that data). A reason why we are moving away from Cephs is because it is only effective in Proxmox, which is the reason for making space to create ZFS file system.
