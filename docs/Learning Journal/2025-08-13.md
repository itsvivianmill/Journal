Today, I learned that web-hooks can be implemented in [[Grafana]] for alerting in use cases like Discord. 

In our server, we were introduced to [[Loki]], which is a syslog aggregator. 
Reason for use: 
- Loki is able to work with older and newer systems. 
- LXC needs journalctl to contain the system information which is an older system. 
Struggle: 
- Maintaining storage usage

[Grafana Dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) are customizable for any use case, which can be pushed using Git for others to review and implement in the live system. 

There was an introduction on the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) LXC, which is an open-source home automation platform that allows users to control and automate various smart home devices.
